## üåê Network Reliability Strategy (Technical Solutions)

Given the persistent challenges with internet connectivity in many regions of Sudan, especially in rural or conflict-affected areas, our application "Nabdaa" is engineered with **resilience and offline-first capabilities** in mind.

### Key Technical Approaches:

- **Offline Mode (Local Caching):**  
  The app supports local storage of essential data such as emergency numbers, booked appointments, and previously accessed health advice. This allows users to continue using key features even without active internet.

- **Data Syncing System:**  
  Once the internet connection is restored, the application automatically syncs user activities and updates from the health sector servers, ensuring the data remains consistent and up-to-date.

- **Lightweight Architecture: (Not Tested Fully Yet)**  
  The application is built with a minimal data footprint to reduce loading times and function smoothly over **2G/3G mobile networks**, common in many parts of Sudan.

- **SMS-Based Notifications: (In Progress)**  
  For critical updates like epidemic alerts or quarantine instructions, we use **SMS fallback** to ensure users are notified even when mobile data is unavailable.

- **Local Wireless LAN for Clinics and Hospitals: (Proposal)**  
  To prevent internal delays in health centers, we plan to deploy **wireless LAN networks (Wi-Fi)** that interconnect all hospital devices and applications within a single location. This ensures reliable internal communication, even when external internet is down.

- **Network Signal Boosters/Repeaters: (Proposal)**  
  In facilities where mobile signal is weak, we intend to install **signal amplifiers** (such as Wi-Fi extenders or mobile repeaters) to strengthen connectivity within the building and support app features smoothly.

With these solutions, we aim to ensure that **connectivity issues never become a barrier** to accessing vital health services and epidemic alerts in Sudan.
