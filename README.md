# Health Epidemic Detection

## Overview
The Healthcare Sudan Project is a comprehensive healthcare management system developed for the Code For Sudan Hackathon. It addresses two critical challenges faced by the Sudanese population in the medical field:
1. **Delayed epidemic detection and response**, which often leads to widespread outbreaks and loss of life.
2. **Difficulties in accessing medical care**, including long wait times, lack of information about hospital services, and inefficient appointment systems.
