# Health Epidemic Detection

## Overview
The Healthcare Sudan Project is a comprehensive healthcare management system developed for the Code For Sudan Hackathon. It addresses two critical challenges faced by the Sudanese population in the medical field:
1. **Delayed epidemic detection and response**, which often leads to widespread outbreaks and loss of life.
2. **Difficulties in accessing medical care**, including long wait times, lack of information about hospital services, and inefficient appointment systems.

The system consists of three interconnected applications designed to streamline healthcare services, improve communication, and enhance data management for citizens, healthcare providers, and ministry employees.
